    <h1 class="fw-bold">Conclusions</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This section provides a concise non-technical synthesis of the project’s findings, aimed at pilots and planners.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Relevant Findings</h2>

    <ol class="fs-6" style="line-height: 2.0;">

      <!-- 1 -->
      <li><strong>Where was historically thermal lift strongest (spatial clusters on map)?</strong></li>
      <p>
        This is one of the project's central outcomes and can be interactively explored in the map. Historically,
        thermal lift was strongest across the Austrian mountain ridges, especially prominent in well-known flying
        areas such as Bischling and Zell am See.
      </p>

      <div class="figure-placeholder">FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — Map of spatial thermal clusters</div>

      <!-- 2 -->
      <li><strong>At what height above ground was thermal lift strongest?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Strong thermals are not limited to high altitudes. Thermal strength appears remarkably stable across a wide
        range of entry heights. Although most thermals are first encountered between 0–600 m AGL, strong lift
        (2.6–3.0 m/s) occurs up to 1800 m AGL. This demonstrates that thermals extend vertically through the boundary
        layer, and strong cores may be intercepted at many levels — an important insight for beginners who may not
        climb high early in a flight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maximum climb does not depend strongly on entry height, indicating that usable thermals form from very low
        levels (~200 m AGL) up to 1800+ m AGL.
      </p>

      <div class="figure-placeholder">FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — Bar chart of climb vs. entry height</div>

      <!-- 3 -->
      <li><strong>When was lift strongest (time-of-day, seasonality)?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Average maximum climb peaks around 11 AM. Since the number of thermals is also highest between 10 AM and
        12 PM, this may reflect both optimal heating conditions and the tendency of skilled pilots to launch during
        this window.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seasonality patterns match intuition: spring thermals are sharper and more aggressive due to colder ground;
        summer thermals are abundant but often softer. Slightly lower summer climb rates may reflect that more
        beginners fly during peak vacation season.

      <!-- 4 -->
      <li><strong>Can clustering reveal thermal “types”?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Yes — five distinct thermal types were identified. Summary below; details are in <em>clustering.html</em>.

      <li><strong>How consistent/reliable are thermal hotspots over time?</strong></li>
      <p>This question remains out of scope for the current analysis.</p>

      <!-- 6 -->
      <li><strong>What is the best takeoff time for strong, consistent thermals?</strong></li>
      <p>The takeoff time is not stored in IGC files. This question was out of scope.</p>

      <!-- 7 -->
      <li><strong>Do advanced gliders outperform beginner gliders (EN-A/B)?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Many beginners worry that EN-A wings cannot climb as efficiently. However, the data shows no strong
        correlation between wing rating and thermal performance. Even beginner wings can climb efficiently and
        enable long XC flights.
      </p>

      <div class="figure-placeholder">FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — Wing rating vs climb</div>

      <!-- 8 -->
      <li><strong>Which weather features predict good thermal activity?</strong></li>

      <p>Two different models were optimized:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermal yes/no prediction:</strong> shortwave radiation, boundary layer height, low cloud cover, LCL height, windspeed (10m)</li>
        <li><strong>Strong vs weak thermal prediction:</strong> dewpoint (2m), thermal potential ratio, shortwave radiation, LCL height, wind-stress proxy (wind² at 2m)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A brief explanation of these features is provided in the Data page.</p>

      <div class="figure-placeholder">FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — Feature importance plot</div>

      <!-- 9 -->
      <li><strong>Given today’s weather, can we predict best sites and strong-lift probability?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Yes — the interactive map uses today’s weather forecast to compute thermal probabilities across Austria’s
        known hotspots. Predicting exact climb rates was not feasible with the current dataset but could be improved
        in future work.
      </p>

      <div class="figure-placeholder">FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — Interactive map output example</div>

      <!-- 10 -->
      <li><strong>How do wind profile and shear impact thermal strength?</strong></li>

      <p>
        Wind profile was not the focus of this analysis. Only 10 m windspeed was included, and it does not appear as
        a top predictor of strong thermal likelihood — suggesting that as long as winds are low, they do not
        significantly degrade thermal strength.
      </p>

    </ol>
