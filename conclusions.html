      <p class="mb-4">
        This section provides a concise, non-technical synthesis of the project’s results, aimed at pilots
        and flight planners.
      </p>

      <!-- FINDINGS -->
      <h2 id="findings" class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Relevant Findings</h2>

      <ol class="fs-6" style="line-height: 1.9;">

        <!-- 1 -->
        <li><strong>Where was historically thermal lift strongest?</strong></li>
        <p>
          The <a href="interactive_map.html" class="text-primary text-decoration-none">interactive map</a>
shows that thermal lift historically concentrates along the Austrian mountain
          ridges, especially in well-known flying locations such as Bischling and Zell am See. These hotspots
          align with common XC routes and ridge structures.
        </p>





        <!-- 2 -->
        <li><strong>At what height above ground was thermal lift strongest?</strong></li>

        <p>
          Strong thermals are not restricted to high altitudes. Thermal strength remains remarkably stable
          from 0–1800 m AGL. Although many thermals begin below 600 m AGL, strong lift (2.6–3.0 m/s) is also
          observed at 1800 m AGL. This reflects thermals extending vertically through the boundary layer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, new pilots do <em>not</em> need to reach great heights to find strong lift — maximum
          climb rates occur at all entry heights.
        </p>


        <figure class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-4">
      
        <img src="images/C1.png"

          Average maximum climb rate (<em>m/s</em>) across different thermal entry heights
          above ground. Strong lift is not limited to high altitude — climb rates remain
          remarkably consistent from 0–1800 m AGL, showing that strong cores can be
          intercepted at many levels of the boundary layer.

        <!-- 3 -->
        <li><strong>When was lift strongest (time-of-day, seasonality)?</strong></li>

        <p>
          Thermal strength peaks around 11 AM on average, which may reflect both natural heating cycles and
          pilot behavior (skilled pilots launching during optimal conditions).
        </p>
        
        <figure class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-4">
        
          <img src="images/C2.png"
               alt="Thermal strength by hour of day"

            Average maximum climb rate by hour of the day, annotated with the number of detected thermals
            for each hour. Thermal strength peaks around <strong>11 AM</strong>, which aligns with the typical
            daily heating cycle. Higher thermal counts between 10 AM and 12 PM suggest that both atmospheric
            conditions and pilot behavior contribute to this pattern.
          </figcaption>
        
        </figure>

        <p>
          Seasonal patterns are intuitive: spring yields sharper, more aggressive lift due to colder ground
          and steeper gradients; summer thermals are abundant but softer. Slightly lower summer climb rates may
          reflect the large number of beginners flying during holidays rather than weaker thermals.
        </p>

          Average maximum climb rate by month, annotated with monthly thermal counts.  
          Spring months (April–May) show the <strong>strongest average lift</strong>, driven by colder ground and
          steeper temperature gradients. Summer thermals remain abundant but typically softer, partly because
          more recreational and beginner pilots fly during this period. Autumn shows a marked decline in lift.

        <li><strong>Can clustering reveal thermal types?</strong></li>

        <p>
          Yes — five thermal “types” emerged in the clustering analysis. Full details are available in the <a href="clustering.html" class="text-primary text-decoration-none">Clustering section</a>.

        <p>This remains out of scope for this project.</p>

        <li><strong>Best takeoff time?</strong></li>
        <p>Takeoff times are not recorded in IGC files, so this was out of scope.</p>

        <li><strong>Do advanced gliders outperform beginners (EN-A/B)?</strong></li>

        <p>
          The data shows no strong correlation between wing rating and climb performance. Even pilots on EN-A
          wings demonstrate efficient thermal use and achieve long XC flights. Pilot skill and weather appear to
          dominate over wing rating in this dataset.

          Average climb rate for EN-A, EN-B, and EN-C wings across low, mid, and high thermal-strength
          categories. The data shows <strong>no clear performance advantage</strong> for higher-rated wings:
          EN-A wings achieve similar climb rates to EN-B and EN-C within comparable thermal conditions.
          This suggests that in this dataset, <strong>pilot skill and weather factors dominate</strong> thermal
          performance more than wing certification level.

        <!-- 8 -->
        <li id="weather"><strong>Which weather features predict strong thermals?</strong></li>

        <p>
          Two models were trained:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thermal yes/no predictor:</strong> shortwave radiation, boundary-layer height, low cloud cover, LCL height, windspeed (10 m)</li>
          <li><strong>Strong vs weak thermal predictor:</strong> dewpoint (2 m), thermal potential ratio, shortwave radiation, LCL height, wind stress proxy (wind²)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Dewpoint and shortwave radiation appear as consistently dominant predictors. Lower dewpoint (drier air)
          favors instability and stronger lift, while strong shortwave radiation increases surface heating and
          drives convection.
        </p>


        <!-- 9 -->
        <li id="prediction"><strong>Given today’s weather, can we predict strong thermals and likely hotspots?</strong></li>

        <p>
          Yes — the interactive map uses the day’s weather forecast to compute prediction probabilities across
          known historic thermal sites. This provides an intuitive, visual assessment of where strong thermals
          are most likely to develop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Predicting exact climb rates was not feasible with the current dataset, as atmospheric inputs were not
          sufficiently dense. A larger or higher-resolution weather dataset would allow this to be improved.
        </p>


        <!-- 10 -->
        <li id="future"><strong>How do wind profile and shear impact thermal strength and usability?</strong></li>
         <p>
        This question was not the main focus of this analysis. Only the feature windspeed at 10m was included. However, this is entirely absent from the features that predict strong thermal likelihood, indicating that as long as winds are low, they do not influence thermals much. 
        </p>

          <figure class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-4">
    
      <img src="images/C5.png"
           alt="Distribution of wind speed at 10 meters"
           class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm"

      <figcaption class="mt-3 text-muted"
                  style="max-width: 650px; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.9rem;">
        Distribution of wind speed at 10&nbsp;m across all detected thermals. Most values fall between
        3–8&nbsp;m/s, with relatively few observations above 10&nbsp;m/s.  
        In this analysis, windspeed at 10&nbsp;m played only a minor role in predicting strong thermal
        likelihood — it was <strong>not selected as an important feature</strong> by the model.  
        This suggests that as long as winds remain generally low to moderate, they do not substantially
        reduce thermal strength.
