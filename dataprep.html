  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">1. Paragliding Flight Data</h2>

  <p>
    Paragliding flight data was obtained from the 
    <a href="https://www.paraglidingforum.com/leonardo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Paragliding Forum Leonardo XC server
    </a>, 
    which provides one of the largest public repositories of GPS flight tracks worldwide. Records include a 
    downloadable <code>.igc</code> file with the full GPS trajectory, as well as separate metadata such as glider type, 
    takeoff location, flight date, distance, and duration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Access was automated with a Python script that logged into the platform using session cookies. The script iterated 
    through Austrian flights for the years 2022-2024, downloading both the GPS track and metadata from the flight 
    tables. Thus the data were stored in two formats: (1) a folder of raw <code>.igc</code> files (one per flight) and 
    (2) a single <code>raw_rows.json</code> file containing the raw HTML content for each flight. The <code>.igc</code> files 
    were downloaded by iterating through the cleaned <code>metadata.csv</code> file, i.e. duplicate and faulty flights were ignored.
  </p>

    🔗 <a href="metadata.csv" target="_blank">Link to metadata.csv</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The JSON file was then further processed and parsed using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to extract structured metadata fields 
    such as flight ID, pilot, takeoff site, glider model, flight date, duration, distances, and XC score. This structured 
    data was assembled into a <code>pandas</code> DataFrame for cleaning and analysis. During preprocessing, dates were 
    converted into a consistent date format, durations were transformed into minutes, distances were cleaned and converted 
    into numeric values, and XC scores were stored as floating-point numbers. The pilot column was dropped to ensure data 
    privacy (for this analysis names are irrelevant, also if a pilot made one or numerous flights). Erroneous text encoding 
    was repaired. Duplicate flight entries, based on metadata, were removed. Flights shorter than 3 minutes, less than 
    3 km in total distance or less than 1 km in open distance were also removed (even though they may not be erroneous, 
    their short contribution to the dataset as a whole is negligible). There were no missing values. The DataFrame was stored as a <code>.csv</code> file 
    for later analysis. After loading the corresponding <code>.igc</code> files, the metadata was filtered 
    to only keep flights with a matching GPS flight track (not all <code>.igc</code>  files were made available for download). Of 4745 flights, 965 remain.

        Data was fetched in HTML format using a custom built API. It was then processed and cleaned into a structured dataframe and saved as (<code>.csv</code>) for further processing. Short-duration flights and implausible records have been removed during preprocessing.

    Dispayed is a snapshot of exemplar raw flight metadata and its structured representation after transformation. Each record 
    corresponds to an individual paragliding flight and contains attributes such as the date, takeoff location, duration, 
    open distance (straight-line), total distance (flown path), and the cross-country (XC) score, along with glider 
    specifications. The XC score is a standardized performance metric calculated from the optimized flown distance 
    (e.g., free distance, triangles) following 
    <a href="https://www.onlinecontest.org/olc-3.0/leagueRules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      OLC rules
    </a>, allowing fair comparison of flights across conditions and pilots.

    </figure>
    
  The distributions of flight duration, open distance, total distance, and XC score exhibit the expected right-skewness of paragliding data, with most flights being relatively short and only a few achieving long durations and distances. After log-transformation, the variables approximate unimodal distributions, improving comparability and reducing the impact of extreme values. The boxplots reveal outliers for open distance and XC score, however these are also to be expected (exceptional long-distance or competition flights).

  <p>
    GPS trajectory files were processed to first extract GPS data files (<code>.igc</code>) from the compressed 
    <code>.kmz</code> archives. Longitude, latitude, and altitude values at 1 Hz resolution were extracted. 
    To enrich the dataset with environmental context, terrain elevation was added from the 
    <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)</a>, 
    allowing computation of altitude above ground level (AGL).

  <p>
    The data transformation is visualized below using a typical summer flight at Zell am See, Austria. The figure shows 
    both a 2D trajectory map, with flight paths plotted over OpenStreetMap basemaps and annotated start/finish points, 
    and a 3D trajectory map, which represents the full spatial trajectory including the altitude dimension.

    Using the added terrain and altitude data, the figure below highlights the altitude above mean sea level (AMSL) as well as above ground (AGL) over time. The profiles demonstrate sustained thermalling phases with significant height gains, consistent terrain clearance, and a typical descent pattern toward landing.
